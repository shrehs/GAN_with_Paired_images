# GAN_with_Paired_Images
### This repository contains an implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to process Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and paired optical images. The goal is to train a GAN model to learn mappings between SAR and optical data, enabling tasks such as colorization, style transfer, and enhanced usability of SAR data for applications like environmental monitoring and geological studies.

# Features
### SAR and Optical Data Alignment: Preprocessing steps ensure paired alignment between SAR and optical images for effective model training.
### GAN Architecture: Uses a modified GAN model optimized for paired image translation tasks.
### Noise Reduction Techniques: Incorporates techniques like Gamma Map Filtering to denoise SAR images.
### Colorization Pipeline: Enables SAR image colorization based on optical data for better visual interpretation.
